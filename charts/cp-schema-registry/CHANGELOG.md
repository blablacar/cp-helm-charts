# Changelog

## cp-schema-registry-v7.3.1-bbc-2

* Schema registry bugfix:
    * chore: Upgraded Caddy server to 2.6.4 in the Schema Registry UI
    * ref: Standardized configuration with a hard-coded config in the Docker image, no
      entrypoint
    * fix: `Oidc_*` Headers are not proxied anymore to the backend Schema
      Registry. This reduces a lot the total header length, avoiding hitting
      the max header length limit on the backend side.
